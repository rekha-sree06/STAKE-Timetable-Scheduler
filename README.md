# STAKE Automated Timetable & Exam Scheduling System

The **STAKE Automated Timetable System** is a comprehensive Python-based automation tool designed to generate **clash-free academic timetables**, **exam schedules**, **invigilator allocation**, and **seating arrangements** for IIIT Dharwad.  
It significantly reduces manual workload, minimizes scheduling errors, and ensures efficient utilization of faculty, classrooms, and resources.

---

##  Project Overview

This system automatically generates:

- **Academic Timetables** (Years 1–4, First & Second Half Semester)
- **Exam Timetables** (First Half & Second Half)
- **Invigilator Allocation**
- **Seating Arrangements for All Exam Days**

The system reads structured **Excel input files** containing faculty, course, L-T-P, and room details and outputs formatted Excel sheets.

##  Key Features

###  Academic Timetables
- Fully automated timetable generation.
- Strict conflict checking:
  - Faculty availability
  - Room availability
  - Merged divisions (CSE/DS/AI)
  - L–T–P slot mapping  
- Balances workload across faculty.
- Generates **color-coded Excel timetables** with merged cells.

###  Exam Scheduling
- Auto-generated exam schedule for first and second half semesters.
- Ensures no clashes across departments and years.
- Balanced subject distribution across exam days.

###  Invigilator Allocation
- Automatic fair distribution of invigilation duties.
- No faculty overload.
- Priority-based allocation logic.

###  Seating Arrangement Automation
- Room-capacity based seat allocation.
- Mixed-branch and mixed-year seating support.
- Day-wise Excel output for all exam phases.

###  Testing & Validation
- Dedicated `tests/` module.
- Validates helper functions and scheduling logic.
- Includes sample inputs and documented test cases.
